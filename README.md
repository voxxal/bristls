# bristLS
> pronounced bristles (/ˈbris(ə)l/)

LSP and syntax highlighting for the Easel programming language.
The language is not open source, so this language server was built by reverse engineering the wasm and js glue.

Currently, this process is done by hand, and so this language server may be behind the current version of Easel by a couple versions. The compiler hash used in the latest build of this LSP is `d5cd3a01c799934dd803`.
